In order to create the python implementation of the project, I followed the tutorial on Google Cloud over creating a web app using the App Engine. I started off by cloning the git repo used in the tutorial, and navigating to the /python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python37/building-an-app/building-an-app-1 directory. I then opened up the main.py file, which is where I did the computation of the random number. I used the random.randint() function to generate my random number inside the root() function, which is what controls what is displayed on the webpage. I also test the randomness of the generator by creating a table of 1000 random numbers and making sure that there are at least 750 unique values. The root() function returns the random number, and that is what is displayed on the webpage. To run the app, I used the console command "python main.py". In order to deploy the app, I used the commands gcloud app create to create an app and gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project {{project-id}} to deploy my project, replacing {project-id} with my project id.
